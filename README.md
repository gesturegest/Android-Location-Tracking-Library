Location-Tracking-Library
=========================
Location tracking library is a standalone library designed to facilitate the use of location data provided by gps or network 
provider. This library will automatically detect the data provider and receive data from that provider.
Apart from this  you can provide the provider name and on the basis of provider name it will get the location data. All the 
data will be stored in static data memebers so you don't need to request provider to get data every time which saves battery life as well.
This library has powerfull features of GCM so that you can control the application from server side.
Using this library you can send the data to the server asynchronously by calling just one method.
You can also add user registration information and you can send it to the server , for all these you just have to call 
few methods
